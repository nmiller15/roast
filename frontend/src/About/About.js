        <p>Roast is an application that I made for me! I started roasting coffee at home to save some money, and fell in love with the craft. This app is designed to keep track of your roasting process, while you roast.</p>
        <p>The minimalist approach is intentional, only tracking what a hobbyist with a stove-top approach might keep.</p>
